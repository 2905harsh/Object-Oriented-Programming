An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies:

1.Interface methods do not have a body – the actual implementation (method body) is provided by the class that implements the interface.

2.When a class implements an interface, it must override and provide concrete implementations for all of the interface’s methods.

3.By default, interface methods are public and abstract, even if you don’t explicitly declare them so.

4.Interface attributes (variables) are by default public, static, and final – meaning they are constants and shared across all implementing classes.

5.An interface cannot have a constructor, because interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.


When working with classes in Java, there's a strict hierarchy: child classes are aware of their parent classes, but parent classes have no knowledge of their children. This creates a dependency during compilation.

If a method defined in a parent class is invoked through a child class, both the child and the parent class must be present at compile time so the compiler can verify type compatibility and ensure correctness.

This often leads to a design issue: to make more functionality available to child classes, developers start pushing common methods higher up in the inheritance hierarchy. Over time, the parent class becomes bloated with unrelated functionalities — a clear violation of good design principles.

Now suppose two child classes (say Dog and Cat) both need a method like breathe().

At first, this method might exist only in the Dog class.

But since Cat also needs it, instead of duplicating the code in both classes, a developer might decide to move that method up to a common parent class, like Animal, so that both child classes can inherit it.

This process is called "pushing a method up" in the class hierarchy — meaning you're moving shared functionality to a more general parent class, higher in the inheritance chain.

Why this becomes a problem:

 1 As more unrelated methods are pushed up:

 2 The parent class becomes bloated with methods it shouldn’t care about.

 3 It violates the Single Responsibility Principle.

 4 You start forcing all child classes to inherit behavior they may not actually need.

This is where interfaces come into play.

// Power of Interfaces
Interfaces decouple the method definition from the class hierarchy. Unlike inheritance, where functionality is passed down, an interface allows a class to declare a contract independently of its position in the class tree.

Two or more classes, even if they are completely unrelated in terms of inheritance, can implement the same interface. This promotes flexibility, modularity, and better code organization. It enables a more composition-over-inheritance approach, which is generally preferred in modern design.
