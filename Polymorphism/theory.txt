Poly - means many
Morphism - means Ways to represent

So polymorphism means Many ways to represent a single item.

---TYPES OF POLYMORPHISM---

1) Compile Time / Static Polymorphism

    x) Achieved via Method Overloading 
       -> Method Overloading - Same name of function but differs in return type , types of arguments,number of arguments.
       Eg) Multiple Constructors
           A a = new A();
           A a = new A(int a , int b);

    x) Java determines which constructor or method will be called at compile time.That's why it is called as Compile time polymorphism.

2) Run Time / Dynamic Polymorphism
   
   x) Achieved by Method overriding.
     -> Method overriding - Method overriding in Java allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.The method in the subclass must have the same signature (name, return type or covariant type, and parameters) as the superclass method.
